<div class="page-text">
	The modules that you build are single page applications, which makes them very difficult to work on. Any developer who has built several
	modules has experienced the pain of having to start at the first activity and slowly work through each one to get to the task you working 
	on. I feel your pain, so I the number one goal for SimMod was to include way to easily and quickly load the view your working on without
	having to suffer that pain again. I introduce to you the Developers ToolBox.
	<br /><br />
	<img class="center" src="/assets/img/dev_toolbox.png" style="max-width: 800px; height: auto;" />
	<br /><br />
	<span class="page-text-heading">Overview</span>
	<br />
	<div class="hline" />
	<br />
	The Developer ToolBox is located at the bottom of the screen. To open it, click the arrow in the upper right corner. The first time
	you launch it, it will display a single dropdown menu. Click on the dropdown and you will see a list of pages that are available.
	<br /><br />
	<img class="center" src="/assets/img/dev_toolbox2.png" style="max-width: 800px; height: auto;" />
	<br /><br />
	There are 5 pages available. The page that is of most value is the Simulation Page, this is where all of your activity views are located.
	Click on Simulation Page.
	<br /><br />
	<img class="center" src="/assets/img/dev_toolbox3.png" style="max-width: 800px; height: auto;" />
	<br /><br />
	You will now see two additional dropdown menus. The second one contains a list of all the available activities.
	<br /><br />
	<img class="center" src="/assets/img/dev_toolbox4.png" style="max-width: 800px; height: auto;" />
	<br /><br />
	The third dropdown contains a list of views available for that activity. Choose the Activity and View you want and click the Go button
	and the view will be loaded, it just that easy.
	<br /><br />
	<img class="center" src="/assets/img/dev_toolbox5.png" style="max-width: 800px; height: auto;" />
	<br /><br />
	We designed the Developer ToolBox to always remain on the view that you have set. So when the browser refreshes the page, your
	current view will remain.
	<br /><br />
	The reason we we use the naming conventions we do for activities and views was all due to the Developers ToolBox. This is also
	the reason that you must configure every view individually. If you were to set the activity title in A1V1 and then you use this
	to bypass A1V1 and go directly to A1V2, your view would not have everything that it should. So to ensure that every view would
	function properly and not be missing anything, we required every view file to be responsible so setting up everything that view needs.
	<br /><br />
	Because its up to you as a developer to decide how many views you want to create for an activity, you will need manually need to update
	a JSON file to tell the Developer ToolBox what Activities and Views are available.
	<br /><br />

	<div class="hline" />
	<br />
	The JSON file that you need to configure is located at /src/data/dev-toolbox-data.json. This file is included with SimMod when you clone it, and is not part of the data files that get generated by the SimGen tool.

Simply update this file as you add activities and views to the module. You should at least add all of your activities and the first view
before you start developing.
