    SimMod uses the Vue.js single file component architecture. In modern UI development, we have found that instead of
    dividing the codebase into three huge layers that interweaves with one another, it makes much more sense to divide
    them into loosely-coupled components and compose them. Inside a component, its template, logic and styles are
    inherently coupled, and collocating them actually makes the component more cohesive and maintainable.
    <br/><br/>
    The basic structure of a view component file. The code below shows the three basic parts of an activity view
    component file.

    Let's take a closer look at each of these. We will start off with the template code block.

                />
            </zoom-panel>
        </content-box>
    </view-box>
</template>
</textarea>
    <br/>
    Line 2: Every activity view template must have only one single root element. The root element for every activity
    view template is the
    <em>view-box</em>. The <em>view-box</em> is covered in detail in the Widgets section.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 4: In this example the view template is for <em>A1V1</em>, all first activities will require an <em>intro-screen</em>
    component. This
    component has no attributes or directives. You simply place it directly after the <em>view-box</em> component. You
    will use its <i>show</i>
    method in the <i>introScreen</i> method of the view's sequence file. This is discussed in the topic <i>Activity
    Sequence Files</i>.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 5: If you are working on an equipment module, then a <em>safety-screen</em> component is required. You place
    the <em>safety-screen</em>
    component directly after the <em>intro-screen</em> component. The <em>safety-screen</em> contains a lightbox, text
    and continue button,
    which are automatically rendered when the <i>introScreen</i> audio completes or the student clicks the <em>intro-screen</em>
    <i>continue button</i>.
    <br/><br/>
    The <em>safety-screen</em> has a custom event attribute and a v-if directive.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 6: The <em>@isClosed</em> is a custom event which gets emitted when the student clicks the <i>continue
    button</i>.
    <br/><br/>

    <div class="dev-note">
        The @ symbol is shorthand for the Vue <em>v-on</em> directive. With Vue we can have user defined custom events,
        along with the
        standard set of events like: click, onmouseenter, onmouseleave, onchange, etc.
    </div>

    <br/>
    Line 7: The <em>v-if</em> directive is used to tell the component whether it should be rendered. The SimCore
    Activity object has a method
    <em>safetyIsShown</em> which will return <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>, which is triggered by the
    <em>intro-screen</em>.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 12: The next required element is the <em>content-box</em>. For the most part, all of your activity elements
    will be placed inside this
    component. The <em>intro-screen</em> and <em>safety-screen</em> are placed outside of it because they overlay the
    view. SO any components or
    elements that you place outside the <em>content-box</em> will be rendered with a higher z-index.
    <br/><br/>
    You can learn more about the <em>content-box</em> features in the Widgets section.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 13: A common feature of activities is the ability to zoom in on the view. The <em>zoom-panel</em> widget gives
    you two levels of zoom.
    You wrap all the elements that need to be zoomed with this widget, anything outside the <em>zoom-panel</em> will not
    be zoomed and will be
    rendered at a higher z-index.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 18: The <em>div</em> is used in every activity. A student is given 3 attempts to get the task correct, on
    the 3rd attempt, a hint
    is shown. You position the <em>div</em> using the <i>ID</i> you assign in and creating a set of style
    properties in the
    <em>style</em> code-block at the bottom of the view file. Detailed information about this can be found in the
    Widgets section.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 20: Here we are demonstrating an <i>image</i> element using the <em>@click</em> event to call a task action.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 21: The <em>:class</em> is a bindable attribute.
    <br/><br/>

    <div class="dev-note">
        The : symbol is shorthand for the Vue <em>v-bind</em> directive. A common need for data binding is manipulating
        an elementâ€™s class list and
        its inline styles. Since they are both attributes, we can use v-bind to handle them: we just need to calculate a
        final string with our
        expressions. However, meddling with string concatenation is annoying and error-prone. For this reason, Vue
        provides special enhancements when : is used with class and style. In addition to strings, the expressions can
        also evaluate to objects or arrays.
    </div>

    <br/>

    <div class="dev-note">
        The use of jQuery is not permitted. Like other modern frameworks, such as Angular, Vue manages the rendering of
        components, so you
        can not directly manipulate component DOM elements. You use directives and bindable data properties to interact
        with elements.
    </div>

    <br/>
    For this example we needed to have the cap image be displayed in two different locations for the task. One for when
    the cap is "on" the part
    and then another location when the cap is removed. So we created two css classes that define the position of the cap
    in the "on" and "off"
    positions.
    <br/><br/>
    <em>:class="{ on: blueCapOn, off: blueCapOff }"</em> what we are doing here is using an object with the name of the
    classes as the "Key" and
    then we created data properties: <em>blueCapOn</em> and <em>blueCapOff</em> as the "Value", which are defined in the
    <em>data</em> method property of the
    <em>script</em> code-block which we will discuss in the next section below. When the value of the data property is
    set to <i>true</i>, the class
    is applied to the image.
    <br/><br/>

                                                                  target="_blank">

    <span class="page-text-heading">CodeBlock: Script</span>
    <br/>
    <div class="hline"/>
    <br/>
    This sample code shows a generic outline of the script block.
    <br/>
    <textarea>
<script>
import A1V1Seq from './a1v1-seq.js'
import ViewBox from '../../widgets/ViewBox'
import ContentBox from '../../widgets/ContentBox'

export default {
    name: 'A1V1',
    components: {
        ViewBox,
        ContentBox
    },
    data() {
        return {
            // Data properties go here
        }
    },
    mounted() {
        // Activity startup code goes here
    },
    methods: {
        // Required for sequence file
        ...A1V1Seq,
        // Activity Helper functions go here
    }
}
</script>
</textarea>
    <br/>
    The script block is made up of a list of imports and a default class object. The class object contains properties
    and methods
    that are required for the view component to function properly.
    <br/><br/>

    <span class="page-text-heading">Import Statements</span>
    <br/>
    <div class="hline"/>
    <br/>
    Continuing with our example code, these are the imports that are required. The import statement is used to import
    functions, objects or
    primitives that have been exported from an external module, another script, etc.
    <br/>
    <textarea>
<script>
import A1V1Seq from './a1v1-seq.js'
import ViewBox from '../../widgets/ViewBox'
import ContentBox from '../../widgets/ContentBox'
import IntroScreen from '../../widgets/IntroScreen'
import SafetyScreen from '../../widgets/SafetyScreen'
import ZoomPanel from '../../widgets/ZoomPanel'

....
</script>
</textarea>
    <br/>
    When importing you will need to provide a <em>name</em> that will refer to the default export from the module,
    followed by a path to where
    you are importing the module from.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 2: <em>A1V1Seq</em> imports methods from the views sequence file. You will learn about it in the Activity View
    Files page.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 3: <em>ViewBox</em> imports the view-box widget.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 4: <em>ContentBox</em> imports the content-box widget.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 5: <em>IntroScreen</em> imports the intro-screen widget.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 6: <em>SafetyScreen</em> imports the safety-screen widget.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 7: <em>ZoomPanel</em> imports the zoom-panel widget.
    <br/><br/>
    <strike>Line 8: <em>HintBox</em> imports the hint-box widget.</strike>
    <br/><br/><br/>

    <span class="page-text-heading">Default Module: Name & Components Options</span>
    <br/>
    <div class="hline"/>
    <br/>
    Here we will examine the first two properties of the module.
    <br/>
    <textarea>
export default {
    name: 'A1V1',
    components: {
        ViewBox,
        ContentBox,
        IntroScreen,
        SafetyScreen,
        ZoomPanel
    },
    ....
}
</textarea>
    <br/>
    Line 1: SimCore has an activityViewContainer that this view file is imported into, so we must export this as a
    default module.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 2: The <em>name</em> option is the name of this module. You must use the naming convention as shown or the
    module will not load.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 3: The <em>components</em> option is an object containing a list of all the widgets using the name that was
    used in import statement.
    <br/><br/><br/>

    <span class="page-text-heading">Default Module: Data Option</span>
    <br/>
    <div class="hline"/>
    <br/>
    The data option is much more than that. Anything in the data option will become <i>"reactive"</i> with the setters
    and getters that
    Vue adds. The data option must be a function and it must return all the data properties as an object.
    <br/>
    <textarea>
export default {
    ....

    data() {
        return {
            // Required Properties
            isClickable: false,
            currentTask: 't1',
            currentAttempts: 1,
            currentPoints: 3,
            backgroundImg: 'engine_compartment.png',

            // View Specific properties 
            zoomPanelBgImg: {
                background: 'url(/assets/img/zoom-panel/engine_compartment_zoom.png)',
                backgroundSize: '105%'
            },
            blueCapOn: true,
            blueCapOff: false,
            redCapOn: true,
            redCapOff: false,

            // Hints should always follow this naming convention
            t1ShowHint: false,
            t2ShowHint: false
        }
    },

    ....
}
</textarea>
    <br/>
    Line 7: The <em>isClickable</em> data property is required for <em>:clickable</em> attribute of the
    <em>content-box</em>. Detailed information
    about the <em>content-box</em> can be found in the Widgets section.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 8: The <em>currentTask</em> data property. While developing sequences it is often required to perform task
    actions based what the current
    task is, this data property keeps track of it. You should set this to whatever the initial first task is for the
    view that you are working on.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 9: The <em>currentAttempts</em> data property is required by the <em>incorrect</em> method which will be
    covered later on this page.
    Students are given 3 attempts to get a task correct. Each time <em>incorrect</em> is called, it will increment this
    number. The
    counter checks to see if this value is less than 3, so by default it needs to be set to 1, because it will always
    take at least 1 attempt to
    get the task correct.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 10: The <em>currentPoints</em> data property is also required by the <em>incorrect</em> method. A task by
    default can have up to 3 points.
    Each time a student gets a incorrect attempt, the points are reduced by 1. If the student gets 3 wrong attempts, 0
    points will be awarded.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 11: The <em>backgroundImg</em> data property is required by the <em>view-box</em>.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 14: The <em>zoomPanelBgImg</em> is required by the <em>zoom-panel</em>.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 18 - 21: These data properties are used specifically for this activity view. In the section above about the <i>template</i>,
    I showed
    you an example of a bindable class, the class passed in an object with 2 keys and values, these properties are the
    boolean values that
    the images bindable class uses.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 24: Every activity task will use a <em>v-hint</em> directive on DOM Element
    which is used to tell
    the <em>DOM Element</em> to enable the hint. You need to create these data properties by prepending a lowercase "t"
    and
    the task number to
    <em>"ShowHint"</em>. The <em>incorrect</em> method requires this so that it can set the value to true for the
    current task.
    <br/><br/><br/>

    <span class="page-text-heading">Default Module: Mounted Option</span>
    <br/>
    <div class="hline"/>
    <br/>
    The mounted option is a life cycle hook function that is called when the view component is ready and mounted to the
    DOM. Anything placed
    inside here will immediately be available when the function is called.
    <br/>
    <textarea>
export default {
    ....

    mounted() {
        // Configure the view (Activity Title, View Mode[full/box], Activity ID)
        this.$core.Activity.configView('System Recovery', 'full', 'A1')
        
        // Initialize the activity view
        this.$core.Activity.init([this.introScreen])

        // Show Zoom Icons
        this.$core.IconBar.Zoom.show()

        // Show and Enable SI Menu Icon
        this.$core.IconBar.ServiceInfo.show()
        this.$core.IconBar.ServiceInfo.enable()
    },    

    ....
}
</textarea>
    <br/>

    <div class="dev-note">
        Before we discuss the mounted option, I want to talk about the use of the "this" key word. <em>this</em> refers
        to the instance of
        the Vue component and in our case <em>this</em> refers to the view you are working on. SimCore provides a lot of
        core methods for you
        and you will need to use the <em>this</em> keyword when using these methods. You can learn about each of
        SimCores methods in the
        Core: API section.
        <br/><br/>
        Another thing that I need to discuss the <em>$core</em>. SimCore's functionality is global, the <em>$</em>
        represents a global
        reference. In the section on Activity Sequence Files, you will need to import the Vue object for use with the
        TransitionToView and
        EndActivity methods because of how these methods work, the callback function can't access <em>this</em> instance
        of the view, so we
        replace the <em>this</em> keyword with <em>Vue</em> and then we drop the <em>$</em> off <em>$core</em>, the
        reason for this is that
        when we use <em>Vue</em> we are referring to the global namespace, so we do not need the <em>$</em> to access
        core functionality.
        <br/><br/>
        Don't worry if right now this seems confusing, it will make more sense once you get familiar with the sequence
        file. I just felt it
        was worth mentioning now.
    </div>

    <br/>
    Every activity view is independent of the others, so it's required to configure every view.

    <br/><br/>
    Line 6: To configure a view you call <em>this.$core.Activity.configView()</em>. Activity is a $core object which has
    many methods.
    The <em>configView</em> method requires 3 parameters:
    <br/>
    <ol>
        <li>Activity Title: The name of the activity you are working on.</li>
        <li>View Mode: Full or Box (This was discussed in the Introduction to this section)</li>
        <li>Activity ID: The naming convention for this is an uppercase "A" followed by the activity number</li>
    </ol>
    <br/>
    Line 9: The next thing that you must do is initialize the view. To do this you call core's <em>init</em> method. The
    <em>init</em> method
    takes one parameter in the form of an array, its required that its passed in as an array, even though its a single
    parameter. What you are
    passing in is the first method in the sequence file that needs to be called. If you are working on the first
    activity of a module, then you
    need to call the <em>introScreen</em> method and to call any of the methods you need to prepend it with the
    <em>this</em> keyword. For any
    other view file you would call the first task or narrative. You will learn more about sequence methods in the
    Activity Sequence Files section.
    <br/><br/>
    When working on activities you will need show and enable various icons on the iconbar. You will handle these from
    the <em>mounted</em> option.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 12: In our example we are using the <em>zoom-panel</em> so we need to show the zoom icons. To do this you call
    the <em>show</em> method
    of core's IconBar.Zoom object. More info about IconBar can be found in the CORE: API section.
    <br/><br/>
    Another commonly used icon is for Service Information. This icon needs to be shown first and then enabled. Depending
    on the activity
    sometimes you will show and enable the icon at the same time, other times you might need to show the icon and that
    when instructed, then
    enable it.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 15: To show the Service Information icon you call the <em>show</em> method, just like we did for the zoom
    icons.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 16: Now we need to enable the icon, you do this by calling the <em>enable</em> method.
    <br/><br/>
    So to recap, you handle anything that the view needs here in the <em>mounted</em> option.
    <br/><br/><br/>

    <span class="page-text-heading">Default Module: Methods Option</span>
    <br/>
    <div class="hline"/>
    <br/>
    The methods option contains all the functions that the view uses. We import sequence methods from the activity view
    sequence file. You will
    write view helper functions here.

    Line 6: When we looked at the import statements the first import was <em>A1V1Seq</em>, here we are using that import
    to add all the
    sequence methods. It uses the <i>ES6 spread operator</i> <em>...</em>, which is a shorthand way of grabbing all the
    methods that are exported and not having to individual list them.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 9: We have discussed the <em>isClickable</em> data property and that it was required by the <em>incorrect</em>
    method. Well here is that method. This method is called from the <em>content-box's</em> action <em>@action</em>
    event. It passes in the <em>currentTask</em>.
    Another param for this method is <em>draggable</em> that means the method should use second hint named as <em>t#ShowHint2</em>
    Second hind will change value to true if user drags item in wrong location. This is often use by tooltray widget which is explained
    on this section <a class="router-link" href="widgets/tool-tray">ToolTray</a>.

    <br/><br/>
    Line 12: This increments <em>currentAttempts</em> by 1.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 13: This decreases <em>currentPoints</em> by 1.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 14: If <em>currentAttempts</em> equals 3, then the student is out of attempts.

    Line 15: Calls the <em>incorrectResponse</em> sequence method.

    Line 16: Here we are dynamically creating the ShowHint data property. As discussed <em>this</em> represents the
    instance of this view,
    which is an object, because it's an object we can use an objects bracket syntax <em>object['propertyName']</em> to
    reference the data
    property for the current tasks ShowHint property by concatenating the <em>currentTask</em> to "ShowHint" -
    <em>this[task + 'ShowHint']</em>, gives us for example <em>t1ShowHint</em> which we then set it to true. Now the
    hint will show.
    <br/><br/>
    Line 17: The student has used up all their attempts, so they will not be awarded any points, so we set <em>currentPoints</em>
    to 0.

    As I stated above, the methods option is used for view helper functions, so lets take a look at some examples of
    some of the helper functions
    I create for a module I was working on.
    <br/><br/>
    For the module I was working on I have a knob that the student needs to rotate between the On and Off positions for
    different tasks. The
    challenge was having the knob do multiple things at different times. One approach would be to create separate knobs
    and have a different
    <em>@click</em> event for each knob, but that would be repetitive and simply not a clean approach, so to solve the
    issue I created a helper
    method <em>whichTask()</em>.
    <br/>
    <textarea>
<template>
    ....
    <div id="knob-low" @click="whichTask()"></div>
    ....
</template>
</textarea>
    <br/>
    <textarea>
methods() {
    ....

    // The click event needs to call a diffrent function
    // based on what the current task is when it's clicked.
    whichTask() {
        if (this.currentTask === 't10') {
            this.t10a2()
        } else if (this.currentTask === 't11') {
            this.t11a2()
        } else if (this.currentTask === 't12') {
            this.t12a2()
        } else if (this.currentTask === 't13') {
            this.t13a2()
        }
    },

    ....
}
</textarea>
    <br/>
    The <em>whichTask()</em> method, simply compares the <em>currentTask</em> to the defined task and then calls the
    task action that it needs.
    This would be a best practice approach to handing situations like this, which you will encounter more often then
    not.

    <div class="dev-note">
        In the Activity Sequence Files section you will learn about creating Task functions and Task Action functions.
        In the above code block
        on line 8 you see a reference to <em>this.t10a2()</em>. That refers to Task 10 Action 2. Sequence methods follow
        a naming convention
        of using a lowercase "t" for task followed the the task number for task functions and then appending a lowercase
        "a" for action followed by
        a number, when looking at <em>t10a2()</em>, its easy to know that there is also a <em>t10a1()</em> method.

    Every view file has it's own set of css styles. The one great feature about this is that the views styles are
    scoped, which means they
    are encapsulated and can not interfere with any of the other views styles, so you can have a class with the same
    name in two different files
    and not have to worry about it.

    Here are a few styles from the module that the above examples have been using. You can see the ON and OFF classes
    for the caps that I covered
    earlier. You can also see how to position hints.
