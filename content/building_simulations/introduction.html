	<span class="page-text-heading">Automotive Simulation-Based Learning</span>
	<br /><br />
	The simulation-based learning module is designed to be user-friendly and appeal to a broad range of students. 
	<br /><br />
	The program’s adaptive layout will be accessible on a range of devices through browsers. Students will be able to manipulate simulations through keyboard strokes or a mouse. Response times will be under 6 seconds for simulations and 3 seconds for static text— including downloads.

	<br />
	Modules are broken down into 6 sections:
	<br />
	<ol>
		<li>Home Page</li>
		<li>Video Page</li>
		<li>Simulations</li>
		<li>Review Questions</li>
		<li>Score Card</li>
		<li>Performance Report</li>
	</ol>
	<br />

	<strong>Home Page</strong>
	<br />
	The Home Page includes the Series Title, Module Title and 3 buttons. The titles are automatically added to the page from the
	module_data.json file. The first button "Using the Simulation" will be the same for all modules, clicking it will load the
	Video Page with the corresponding video. 
	<br /><br />
	The second button will vary based on the type of module (Understanding the Concepts or Understanding the Equipment), clicking on this button will also load the Video Page with its corresponding video. 
	<br /><br />
	The third button "Enter Simulation" will also be the same for all modules, clicking it will load the Simulations section.


	<br /><br />
	There are 2 types of modules: Understanding the Concepts & Understanding the Equipment. 
	<br /><br />
	<span class="page-text-heading">Understanding the Concepts:</span>
	<br />
	These modules provide activities that focus on teaching the students conceptual ideas about a subject. The activities you
	will be building will typically involve interactive diagrams and matching terms to their definitions.
