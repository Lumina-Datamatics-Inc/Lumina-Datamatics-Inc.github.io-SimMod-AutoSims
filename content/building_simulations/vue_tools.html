	Vue apps are a joy to write, and often fairly easy to debug. But do you know what would make debugging better? A dedicated way to hook 
	into Vue apps and manipulate them from your browser’s devtools. Vue2 now has an updated Chrome plugin that makes debugging simple and
	easy.
	<br /><br />
	Vue has a quality Chrome extension that allows inspecting component trees, reviewing events, and time-travel debugging of Vuex states. 
	These features make debugging ridiculously simple, even for fairly large apps.
	<br /><br />

	<span class="page-text-heading">Installation</span>
	<br />
	<div class="hline" />
	<br />
	The Vue devtools can be installed from the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store.</a>
	<br /><br /><br />

	<span class="page-text-heading">Component Tree</span>
	<br />
	<div class="hline" />
	<br />
	The devtools provide a DOM-style tree overview of all the components in your app, with information about each component’s data, 
	properties, computed properties, and vuex bindings in the details pane.
	<br /><br />

	<br /><br />
	This is an invaluable tool, at any time you can check to see the state of your data properties. To see all the data properties for a
	view, click on the tree node with the view's ID - in this the image above the viewID is A1V1. The panel on the right displays a list
	of all the data properties and their current values. This gives you the ability to watch the properties in real-time to make sure that
	they are getting set.
	<br /><br /><br />

	<span class="page-text-heading">Time-Travel Debugging</span>
	<br />
	<div class="hline" />
	<br />
	Hands down the most useful feature of the devtools is time-travel debugging for apps using Vuex. It allows you to observe, revert, and
	flatten your Vuex store over time. You could use this to revert to a previous state, replay events to get a second look at bugs, or inspect
	the various moving parts that go into making a Vuex store work in the details pane.

	In the upper right-hand corner you will see the Export and Import icons. Export will copy all data to the clipboard and Import lets
	you select a data property and them import new data to update it.
