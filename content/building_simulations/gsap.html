	Think of GSAP as the Swiss Army Knife of javascript animation... but better. It animates anything JavaScript can touch (CSS properties,
	canvas library objects, SVG, generic objects, whatever) and it solves countless browser inconsistencies, all with blazing speed (up to 
	20x faster than jQuery), including automatic GPU-acceleration of transforms. 
	<br /><br />
	Most other libraries only animate CSS properties. Plus, their sequencing abilities and runtime controls pale by comparison. Simply put, 
	GSAP is the most robust high-performance javascript animation library on the planet, which is probably why Google recommends it for 
	JS-based animations and every major ad network excludes it from file size calculations. Unlike monolithic frameworks that dictate how 
	you structure your apps, GSAP completely flexible; sprinkle it wherever you want.
	<br /><br />
	GSAP consists of the following core tools, plus quite a few plugins, eases, and special utilities like Draggable and SplitText:
	<br /><br />
	
	<span class="page-text-heading">Draggable</span>
	<br />
	When you pair GreenSock's Draggable with ThrowPropsPlugin, you get the ultimate tag-team for making a DOM element draggable, spinnable,
	tossable, and even flick-scrollable! You can impose bounds, have things glide to a stop in a silky-smooth way, and do it all with as little
	as one line of code. No kidding. Works great on touch devices too.
	<br /><br />

	<span class="page-text-heading">TweenLite</span>
	<br />
	TweenLite is the fast, lightweight, and flexible core of GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), a JavaScript library for HTML5 animation.
	<br /><br />

	<span class="page-text-heading">TweenMax</span>
	<br />
	TweenMax extends TweenLite, adding many useful (but non-essential) features like repeat(), repeatDelay(), yoyo(), staggered tweens, and
	more. It also includes many extra tools and plugins by default, making it extremely full-featured (TweenLite, TimelineLite, TimelineMax,
	CSSPlugin, AttrPlugin, RoundPropsPlugin, DirectionalRotationPlugin, BezierPlugin, and EasePack).
