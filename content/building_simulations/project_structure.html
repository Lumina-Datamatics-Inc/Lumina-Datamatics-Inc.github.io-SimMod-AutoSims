<div class="page-text">
	Now it's time to introduce you to the projects directory structure. I will guide you through each of the directories and the files
	that they contain. 
	<br /><br />
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 550px; vertical-align: top;">
				The root directory contains all of the project files. As an activity developer you only need to be concerned with
				two of the directories. The <em>build</em> and <em>src</em> directories.
				<br /><br />
				The build directory is where all of the files get placed when you run a production build, which will be covered in another section.
				<br /><br />
				The <em>src</em> directory is the main folder that you will be working in. 
				
				<br /><br />
				<span class="page-text-heading">Activities Folder</span>
				<br />
				<div class="hline" />
				<br />
				Each activity is stored in its own folder. All folders follow the same naming convention. A lowercase "a" followed
				by the activity number. When you clone the SimMod project, the a1 folder is there by default. You will need to create the
				additional folders based on how many activities the module that you are working on has.
				<br /><br />
				Activities have two types of files. A View file and a Sequence file. Every activity will have at least one view. You
				are required to follow this naming convention. A view file must start with a capital "A" followed by the number of the activity, then a capital "V" and then the number of the view, so by default you will always have an A1V1.vue file. The 
				file will not load if you use lowercase.
				<br /><br />
				The Sequence file also has a naming convention, "a1v1-seq". Lowercase is required for these files. Sequence files are JavaScript files. Both files are required. We will discuss each of these files, in depth in the next two topics.
				<br /><br />
				The activities folder also includes a boilerplates folder. In this folder you will find templates for View
				and Sequence files. You can use these templates as a starting point, so that you don't have to type out all the required
				code for each file.

				<br /><br />
				<span class="page-text-heading">Assets Folder</span>
				<br />
				<div class="hline" />
				<br />
				The assets folder is where you place all you audio, video and image files. It also contains a css and js folder, which
				you will not use for building activities.
				<br /><br />
				When you start a new module project, you will be given a set of audio files. Audio files also follow a naming convention.
				You will place the audio files into their corresponding folder. The a1 folder is provided by default and you will need
				to create additional folders, following the same naming convention. 
				<br /><br />
				In addition to audio files, you will grab all the image files for a module from the SharePoint site and you will need
				to place them in various locations. 
				<br /><br />
				Activity images go into the activities folder and you organize them just like with
				audio files using a1, a2, etc. 
				<br /><br />
				If your module uses the Parts Department you will place the part images and the background into this folder. 
				<br /><br />
				For the Service Information menu, you place all images that need to be displayed in the Service Information window into 
				the si-content folder.
				<br /><br />
				When using the Zoom feature, you will need to place a large (2560 x 1440) background image for the activity view in
				the zoom-panel folder. The background image must be exactly that size or it will not align properly.
				<br /><br />
				The module folder is where you place standard backgrounds and other common module images.
				<br /><br />
				You will also need to grab the required video files from SharePoint and place them into Video folder. You will need
				to rename the original files. Using the Concepts video gets renamed to uconcepts.mp4 and Understanding the Equipment
				gets renamed to uequipment.mp4. If you do not use these names, the videos will not load.

				<br /><br />
				<span class="page-text-heading">Data Folder</span>
				<br />
				<div class="hline" />
				<br />
				When you setup the project you grabbed a zip folder that contains various json files, separated into two sub-folders,
				module-data and activity-data.
				<br /><br />
				<strong>Module Data:</strong>
				<br />
				These files provide the module with data for such things as: activity title, menu items, task list, review questions & 
				answers, along with end of activity screens and service information items. You simply copy these files directly into 
				the data folder and SimCore will know where to locate them.
				<br /><br />
				<strong>Activity Data:</strong>
				<br />
				Each activity has its own set of data files. There are three possible files, the first two are always provided; 
				a#-task-data.json and a#-response-data.json. The third file a#-assessment.json will only be available if the activity
				has an assessment. The section <em>JSON Data</em> will go over each of these files in detail.
				<br /><br />
				<strong>Tooltray Data:</strong>
				<br />
				This file contains a#-tooltray-data.json file which is contains information about tooltray items. For more info: <a class="router-link" href="widgets/tool_tray">ToolTray</a>
				<br /><br />
				You need to place the activity files in separate activity folders: a1, a2, etc.

				<br /><br />
				<span class="page-text-heading">Review Questions Folder</span>
				<br />
				<div class="hline" />
				<br />
				This folder contains a single file - ReviewQuestionsTemplate.vue. This is the file you use to layout the
				review questions using the custom layout components.

				<br /><br />
				<span class="page-text-heading">SimCore Folder</span>
				<br />
				<div class="hline" />
				<br />
				The SimCore folder contains the all the files required to make the modules work. The only time you need to be
				concerned with this folder is when we release updates or bug fixes. You will simply download the updated SimCore
				zip file, unpack it and replace all the files with the new ones. Trying to edit any of these files will cause the
				module to not function properly.

				<br /><br />
				<span class="page-text-heading">Widgets Folder</span>
				<br />
				<div class="hline" />
				<br />
				The widgets folder contains module widgets, such as HintBox and HotSpots, along with interactive widgets like the
				Ignition Switch. Some widgets are provided for you and others you will need to build depending on the activity you are
				working on. You can also put in a request to have a widget built and we will develop it for you.
				<br /><br /><br />

				Next up... Activity View files.
