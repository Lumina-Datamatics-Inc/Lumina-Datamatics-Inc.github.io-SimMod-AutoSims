<p class="intro-text">
	Welcome to the online documentation for SimCore and SimMod. A platform for rapidly building
	simulation modules. Our platform was designed to make it easier and faster to build simulation
	module activities. We leverage the power of the Vue.js framework and modern web development
	environments so that you can focus on coding activity tasks.

	SimCore is the heart of our simulation platform. It consists of global functionality that handles
	all of the behind the scenes tasks for you, such as building the IconBar and populating menus and
	Task Windows. It handles keeping track of scores and Performance Report data. It abstracts away
	all the common module functionality and exposes an API that lets you focus directly on building
	activities.
	<br /><br />
	We designed SimCore's code to be easily maintainable, ensuring that we could effectively provide
	quick and fast bug fixes, feature updates and platform upgrades. SimCore is maintained in a
	separate repository, so it's not recommended that you modify any of the code. If you come across
	bugs or would like to make suggestions for improvements and need additional features, then submit
	a ticket and we will take care of it and update the core code base and then inform you when you can
	grab a fresh copy and replace it with you existing project core.

	<br />
	SimMod is the base project that you use to build simulation modules. The module code provides a shell that
	has all the global components that make up a module, such as the Home and Video pages, activity pages with a global Header, IconBar, Menus, and activity view templates, Assessments, Task Windows, Score Card and Performance Report. SimMod is a single page application that uses the Vue.js single page component architecture.
