	SimCore is the heart of our simulation platform. It consists of global functionality that handles
	all of the behind the scenes tasks for you, such as building the IconBar and populating menus and
	Task Windows. It handles keeping track of scores and Performance Report data. It abstracts away
	all the common module functionality and exposes an API that lets you focus directly on building
	activities.
